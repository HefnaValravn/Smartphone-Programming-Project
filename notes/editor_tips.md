# TIPS & TRICKS

- Errors because of imports -> Alt + Enter -> Import class
- If method is grey (method never used) -> probably misspelled
- In.putExtra() -> extra layer of protection. First parameter is the vessel, second parameter is the value. Protects data from being changed (if you use a constant as the vessel for example)
